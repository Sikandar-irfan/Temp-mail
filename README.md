## 🔒 Security

This version of TempMail Manager is distributed as an encrypted Python file to protect the intellectual property of the code while still allowing users to run the application. The encryption:

- Provides the same functionality as the original version
- Requires no additional setup beyond running the Python file

### Email Forwarding

3. Create a `.env` file with your SMTP credentials:

```
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your.email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
```
